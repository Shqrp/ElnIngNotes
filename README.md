**Disclaimer**: These notes were made for me, myself and I first and foremost, so if some sections seem strangely structured or explained, that's why. Moreover I decline any responsibility for any mistake in the content I produced. If you do find a mistake, you're encouraged to file an issue or submit a pull request, it would be very appreciated.

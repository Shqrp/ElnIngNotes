# shqrp's notes

In this repo you will find the notes I produced (in Italian) during my time at Politecnico di Milano. Here are the courses I took for which I have provided notes and other materials.

**Disclaimer**: These notes were made for me, myself and I first and foremost, so if some sections seem strangely structured or explained, that's why. Moreover I decline any responsibility for any mistake in the content I produced. If you do find a mistake, you're encouraged to file an issue or submit a pull request, it would be very appreciated.

## Usage

You can download the notes' PDF files in the Releases tab. If I still haven't released the note you need, you just clone the repo and compile your desired file. For example, to compile Calculus I notes, you have to run the following commands.
```
git clone https://github.com/Shqrp/ElnIngNotes
cd ElnIngNotes
typst compile Dispense/Analisi\ Matematica\ I.typ
```
The requested PDF will be available in the `Dispense/` directory. This will also let you modify the documents to your liking.

The flashcards were created and studied through [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). To import them into Anki, you just press `File->Import` or the key combination `CTRL-Shift-I` and select the desired `.txt` file.
